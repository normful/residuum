# More thorough and well-organized than A Dictionary of Basic/Intermediate/Advanced Japanese Grammar

tl;dr: This book covers grammar topics in much greater depth, with more example sentences, and with better organization than the "A Dictionary of Basic/Intermediate/Advanced Japanese Grammar" series, i.e. these books:

I used to believe that the D(B/I/A)JG books were the be-all and end-all of Japanese grammar books for English-speaking learners, but after starting to read through this book, I now know that isn't always the case!

This book is probably too difficult to be your first grammar reference book. A Dictionary of Basic Japanese Grammar is a better choice for learners around studying around the JLPT N5 and N4 level, especially because it has romaji for all example sentences, whereas this book does not have any romaji (but does have furigana above all kanji).

The text in this book is densely packed into two vertical columns of each page, for all entries. The number of example Japanese sentences per page is approximately 14. In contrast, DBJG, DIJG, and DAJG each have approximately 6, 5, and 6 example Japanese sentences per page. There is much more unused blank whitespace in the D(B/I/A)JG books compared to this book.

For some topics, especially basic (i.e. common) ones, the level of depth in this book is far superior to DBJG, and things are organized in a much more accessible way.

Consider, for instance, the explanation of だろう (darou). In this book, だろう is explained with the following subsections:

1. ... だろう (supposition, conjecture) [10 example sentences]
2. ... だろう (confirmation) [3 example sentences]
3. ... だろうか [8 example sentences]
4. ... ではないだろうか [6 example sentences]
5. Nだろうが, Nだろうが [4 example sentences]
6. ... だろうに
6a. ...だろうに [5 example sentences]
6b. ...だろうに [4 example sentences]

In contrast, DBJG covers the basic conjecture meaning of だろう with only a total of 4 example sentences.

In DBIJ, there is an entry on であろう containing 5 example sentences.

For Nだろうが, Nだろうが, there is a brief explanation of it in the entry for 〜と言わず〜と言わず in DAJG, using only 1 example sentence.

There's also a comparative explanation about だろうか versus やら and かしら in DAJG under the entry for やら, with 2 example sentences used.

I cannot find any explanation of だろうに in any of the D(B/I/A)JG books.

In other words, D(B/I/A)JG's coverage of the same topic is far thinner, harder to find because it's scattered across 3 books, and is either only mentioned in passing within other grammar topics, or not mentioned at all.

I've also grown to prefer the concise grammar notation of this book compared with the notation used by the D(B/I/A/)JG books. A lot of space is wasted (IMHO) explaining the grammatical formulation of each grammar pattern in the D(B/I/A)JG books under the "Formation" subsection of each entry, whereas this book either succinctly enumerates the possible formations, skips their enumeration, or thoroughly provides more concrete example sentences for many more flavors of each grammatical topic.

Explanations in English appear after each set of examples in a subsection or sub-subsection. They're concise, and usually contrast a particular topic with a similar one.

Since this book contains all grammar topics, the cross-references and indices contain all levels of grammar. With DBJG, the indexes do not contain entries for intermediate or advanced topics, which can be limiting and troublesome when you need to find a topic in one of the other books. You need to use the index of the DAJG, which lists all entries in the 3 books, if you're unsure about which book a grammar topic appears in. This book does not suffer from that problem, as all topics are in this one single book!

If you're studying for the JLPT N4 or anything higher, I think this book is the most thorough and well-organized grammar reference that you can have. If you know of a better book, I'd be curious to know what it is!

Minor criticisms:

Since the grammatical formulation of some patterns is skipped, you have to either have a good grammatical foundation to be able to infer what part of speech something is. For example, the entry on ものなら does not explicitly state that もの is a noun. You either have to know this from prior studying, or infer it from the example sentences. This is probably not an issue for learners who have passed JLPT N3 or higher, but might be a little annoying for learners who are around the JLPT N4 level.

Other recommended books:

For a strong foundation of fundamental Japanese grammar topics (e.g. nouns, pronouns, interrogative adverbs, embedded questions, passive voice, causative voice, etc.) I would also highly recommend https://www.amazon.com/English-Grammar-Students-Japanese-Learning/dp/0934034168
