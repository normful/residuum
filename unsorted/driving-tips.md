# Driving Tips

This is written from the perspective of driving an automatic transmission vehicle on roads where you drive on the right side (e.g. US and Canada).

## Basic

One of the only things you can control when driving is the amount of space between your car and the car in front of you. Maximizing this distance will maximize the amount of time you have to make a sudden stop, and thus increase the chance of you avoiding and accident.

Always be aware of where all the surrounding cars are.

Resting your left elbow on the door is more stable and comfortable. You should always have both hands on the wheel, but the position that they teach in driving schools is usually not ideal because it's not comfortable enough.

A car will move slowly if you do not press any pedals. If you only need to move a little bit (e.g. entering a parking spot, or during stop-and-go rush-hour traffic), you can release the brake pedal and the car will still move forward slowly. You don't need to press the gas pedal in these situations.

Only use 1 foot for pressing pedals (usually your right foot). Place your right heel on the floor and pivot around that heel to use that single foot for pressing either pedal. If you used two feet, you might accidentally press the wrong pedal (or worse, both pedals) during an emergency, which can cause an accident.

## Small Residential Streets

At 4-way stops, make sure to actually come to a COMPLETE STOP. You will lose points in a driving test if you do not fully stop at a 4-way stop. It is also safest to actually stop, even if you see that there are no other cars around. You may not realize or see a pedestrian walking in the evening. Stopping fully makes sure that you have the time to look around.

## Big City Streets

Making left turns is dangerous. Always be 1000% sure that you have enough of a gap in the traffic to make a left turn safely. If you cannot find a gap, you have to wait until the light turns yellow and the oncoming traffic has slowed down.

## Highway Driving

### Entering the highway

Accelerate quickly on the on-ramp, until you're at the same speed of the traffic you're merging into. This may require flooring the gas pedal (pressing the gas pedal down intensely).

### While on the highway

The safest speed to travel at is the average speed of the surrounding cars. Sometimes the highway has a posted speed limit, but all the other cars are driving about 10% faster than the limit. You should also drive at the same speed that the other cars are driving at. If you drive slower than everyone and obey the limit, you may end up causing an accident because you're blocking other cars.

In a divided highway (where there is a barrier between the directions of the traffic), the fast lane (leftmost lane) is the safest lane to drive in, because you don't have to worry about any cars to the left of you.

### Exiting the highway

If you are just about to miss your exit, do not try to drive across the solid white lines. This is dangerous because you probably are not aware of the cars in the other lane, or you may not change in time and end up in [an accident like this video from the movie Changing Lanes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su64KIPecuo).

Just safely miss the exit and turn back at the next available exit. It's better to be safe and waste a bit of time than to be in an accident.

## Adverse Conditions

The most important rule for driving in bad conditions (rain, snow, fog, construction, gravel roads, etc.) is to SLOW DOWN.

## Winter Driving

You need to use winter tires when there is snow or slush on the roads.

In the winter, always ensure you have a glass scraper and a snow brush in the car (something [like this](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BPLNXC/) is good enough). In case you park your car outside and it snows, you'll need a way to clear the snow off the car. And you also need a way to scrape ice off, in case your car is covered in a layer of ice from freezing rain.

When entering a highway in the winter, read the speed limit on the signs near the on-ramp and obey the speed limits. Normally, in good, dry, summer weather, it is okay to drive a bit above the speed limit of the ramp. But in the winter, it's dangerous if you disobey the ramp's speed limit.

If the weather forecast predicts the air temperature to be around freezing (0 degrees Celsius), before driving, step outside on the roads near your apartment or house and use your foot to feel the ground. If you feel that the roads are slippery, or if the weather forecast warns that there might be freezing rain, you should avoid driving. Freezing rain occurs when rain falls and freezes on the road surface, causing a layer of ice to form. This kind of ice can cause driving conditions where you cannot control your car (e.g. you press the brake pedal but the car doesn't stop). It's better to stay home and don't go into work in these situations.

When windows fog up on the inside, it's because the moisture of the air inside the car condenses as it contacts the cold glass. Even in the winter, you can press the AC button and turn the fan up to the max to turn on the air conditioner (which is also a dehumifier) to remove the moisture in the inside air, and thus defog your windows rapidly. 

You should know which button to press, and how to turn the fan up to the max, ideally within 1 second, because the windows will fog up quickly, and if you cannot see through the glass, you may end up in an accident.

## Rural highways

When on a small rural highway, with only 1 or 2 lanes in each direction of traffic, cars will tend to end up being in packs. 

It's best to be at the back of the pack because in the situation where all the cars need to suddenly slow down or stop (for example, when a moose suddenly walks onto the highway), being at the back ensures that there is no car behind you.
The car behind you may not stop in time, and end up rear-ending your car (i.e. crashing into your car from behind).

Knowing this, it's sometimes safer to let other cars pass you. 

You can do this by either waiting until the road temporarily has two lanes (some highways have a short stretch where this happens, to specifically allow cars to pass each other), slowing down, and allowing all the other cars in the pack to pass you.

Other ways to let all the cars in a pack pass you:
- Stop at a rest area or scenic lookout spot along the highway.
- Turn on your emergency 4-way flasher lights, slow down, and pull over to the shoulder on the right, stop and wait until all the other cars in a pack pass you.

## Road trips

Before long road trips, always check engine oil and tire pressure. The best thing to do is to bring it into a shop to be inspected, so that you minimize the chance that your car breaks down in the middle of nowhere.

Ensure you that have some emergency food, water, blankets, and a flashlight in the trunk in case your car does break down in the middle of nowhere. Always have a charged cellphone, and make sure to continuously be charging your phone in the car, so that you have battery to call for help if you need it.
