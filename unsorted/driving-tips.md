# Driving Tips

These tips are written from the perspective of driving an automatic transmission vehicle on the right side of the road (e.g. US and Canada). Many of these have been passed down to me from observing thousands of kilometers of my dad's driving.

## Basic Tips

One of the only things you can control when driving is the amount of space between your car and the car in front of you. Maximizing this distance will maximize the amount of time you have to make a sudden stop, and thus increase the chance of you avoiding an accident.

Always be aware of where all of the surrounding cars are.

While driving, resting your left elbow on the door is more stable and comfortable. You should always have both hands on the wheel, but the position that they teach in driving schools is usually not ideal because it's not comfortable enough.

A car will move slowly if you do not press any pedals. If you only need to move forward slightly (e.g. when parking or in stop-and-go rush-hour traffic), you can release the brake pedal and the car will still move forward slowly. You don't need to press the gas pedal in these situations, or if you do, you only need to press it gently.

Only use 1 foot for pressing pedals (usually your right foot). Place your right heel on the floor and pivot around that heel to use that one foot for pressing either pedal. If you use both feet, you might accidentally press the wrong pedal (or worse, both pedals) during an emergency, which can cause an accident.

## Small Residential Streets

At 4-way stops, make sure to actually come to a **complete stop**; you'll lose points in a driving test if you don't do this.

It's also safest to fully stop, *even if you see that there are no other cars around*. 

You may not initially realize or see a pedestrian walking in the evening, especially in small residential areas. Stopping fully makes sure that you have the time to look around and notice people in the shadows.

## Big City Streets

Making left turns is dangerous.

Always be 1000% sure (as my dad always likes to say) that you can make a left turn safely. If you cannot find an opportunity where there is a sufficiently large gap in the oncoming traffic, you'll have to wait until the light turns yellow to make the turn, which is normal in heavy traffic.

When the oncoming traffic speed is higher (e.g. 80 km/hr or 55 mph), you'll need an even larger gap in traffic to safely make a left turn.

## Highway Driving

### Entering the highway

Accelerate quickly on the on-ramp until you're at the same speed of the traffic you're merging into. This may require flooring the gas pedal (quickly and strongly pressing down on the gas pedal).

### While on the highway

On a highway, the safest speed to travel at is the average speed of the surrounding cars.

Often all the other cars will drive faster than the posted speed limit. You should also drive at the same speed that the other cars are driving at.

If you drive slower than everyone and obey the limit, you may end up causing an accident because you'd be obstructing other cars due to the speed differential.

In a divided highway (where there is a barrier between the directions of the traffic), the fast lane (the leftmost lane) is the safest lane to drive in, because you don't have to worry about any cars to the left of you.

### Exiting the highway

If you're just about to miss your exit, do not try to drive across the solid white lines. This is dangerous because you probably are not aware of the cars in the other lane, or you may not change in time and end up in [an accident like this video from the movie "Changing Lanes"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su64KIPecuo).

It's safest to just miss the exit, get off at the next available exit, and get back on the highway in the opposite direction to make your way back to where you want to be. It's better to be safe and waste some time backtracking than to be in an accident.

The same advice applies for the scenario where you accidentally are about to get off on the wrong exit, and suddenly want to stay on the highway. It's best to just continue to safely go in the wrong direction and safely backtrack.

## Adverse Conditions

The most important rule for driving in adverse conditions such as rain, snow, fog, construction, or gravel roads is to **SLOW DOWN**.

## Winter Driving

You need to bring your car into the shop and have its tires changed from summer tires to winter tires before the first snow storm of the winter season. The same advice applies for driving in mountainous regions that are cold enough to have snow on the roads. If you ignore this advice, your cars tires will have poor grip, increasing your odds of losing control and causing an accident.

In the winter, always ensure you have a glass scraper and snow brush in your car (something [like this](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BPLNXC/) is good enough). In case you park your car outside and it snows, you'll need a way to clear the snow off the car. And you also need a way to scrape ice off, in case your car is covered in a layer of ice from freezing rain.

When entering a highway in the winter, read the speed limit on the signs near the on-ramp and obey the speed limits. Normally, in good, dry, summer weather, it's okay to drive a bit above the speed limit of the ramp. But in the winter, it's dangerous if you disobey the ramp's speed limit, and you might end up sliding off the on-ramp and into the ditch.

If the weather forecast predicts that the air temperature will be around freezing temperature (0 degrees Celsius or 32 degrees Fahrenheit), before driving, step outside on the ground near your house or apartment and use your foot to check the traction on the ground.

If you feel that the ground is slippery, or if the weather forecast warns that there might be freezing rain, you should avoid driving. Freezing rain occurs when rain falls and freezes on the road surface, causing a layer of ice to form. This kind of ice can cause driving conditions where you cannot control your car (i.e. situations where you press the brake pedal but the car doesn't stop). It's better to stay home in these situations, even if it means missing work.

When windows fog up on the inside, it's because the moisture of the air inside the car condenses as it contacts the cold glass. Even in the winter, you can press the AC button and turn the fan up to the max to turn on the air conditioner (which is also a dehumifier) to remove the moisture in the inside air, and thus defog your windows rapidly. 

You should know which buttons to press to rapidly defog your windows, because if you can't see what's in front of you, you may end up causing an accident.

## Rural highways

When on a small rural highway, with only 1 or 2 lanes in each direction of traffic, cars will tend to end up being grouped into packs. 

It's safest to purposely remain at the back of the pack because you can control how much space is between you and the car in front of you, and ensure that there is no car behind you.

In an emergency situation where all the cars need to suddenly slow down or stop (for example, when a moose, bear, deer, or buffalo suddenly walks onto the highway), being at the back of the pack ensures that there is no car that can accidentally rear-end you (crash into the rear of your car).

Knowing this, it's sometimes safer to let all of the other cars in the pack pass you. 

You can do this by either waiting until the road temporarily has two lanes (some highways have a short stretch where this happens, to specifically allow cars to pass each other), slowing down, and allowing all the other cars in the pack to pass you.

Other ways to let all the cars in a pack pass you:
- Stop at a rest area or scenic lookout spot along the highway
- Turn on your emergency 4-way flasher lights, gradually slow down, pull over to the shoulder on the right, stop and wait until all the other cars in the pack have passed

## Road trips

Before long road trips, always check your car's fluids and tire pressure. You should check these things occasionally too, but it's especially important to check these things before long road trips. Having your car inspected at a shop is the best thing, so that you minimize the chance that your car breaks down in the middle of nowhere.

Ensure you that have some emergency food, water, blankets, and a flashlight in the trunk in case your car does break down in the middle of nowhere. Always be charging your cellphone while driving, so that you have enough power to call for help in an emergency.
